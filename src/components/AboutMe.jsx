        A dedicated and freshly graduated Software Engineer with hands-on
        experience in various programming languages and technologies. My
        academic journey, culminating in a BEng(Hons) in Software Engineering
        from University of Staffordshire UK, has equipped me with a solid
        foundation in software development methodologies. I thrive in dynamic,
        agile environments where collaboration and innovation drive impactful
        results.
      </p>
      <p className="about-me-description">
        I’m passionate about continuous learning and adapting to emerging
        technologies, eager to contribute to meaningful projects and solve
        complex problems with well-structured, clean code. When I’m not coding,
        you’ll find me exploring new tools, experimenting with frameworks, and
        staying up to date with the latest industry trends.
